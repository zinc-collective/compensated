# Compensated
Build products. Get paid.


### Expand Your Sales Channels
You started with a website, and now you have an iOS app.
And oh yea, thereâ€™s that old Gumroad storefront you were experimenting with that has some recurring payments set up.

No matter how you get (or got!) paid, Compensated standardizes the different payment processers data structures and event types so you can add sales channels without losing momentum on your customer facing features.

### Prevent Vendor Lock-In
Tired of your current payment providers fee structure?
Sick of the weird refund policy that locks your account?

Compensated helps you safely transition your customers to new payment processors without requiring system rewrites.

### Read the Source, Luke
All our source code is publicly available.
We build in the open, and grant usage rights freely to any and all individuals. 
But we are _not_ Open Source.
We require organizations to acquire a license so that we have legal standing to refuse to grant usage rights to organizations that violate human rights.

## How It Works
### 1. Install Compensated into your application
### 2. Wire it in to your existing payment event handling code
### 3. Profit!
