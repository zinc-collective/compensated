# Compensated

Build products. Get paid.

## Why Use Compensated

Services like Stripe, Gumroad, Paypal, Apple Pay and other payment processors go a long way towards creating powerful, useful APIs for handling financial transactions.
However, implementing their APIs directly can make it expensive to switch or add vendors.

On the other hand, implementing a layer of indirection to mitigate that cost takes time and energy. Each provider uses different data structures with different design priorities and different event sequences.

Compensated provides that layer of indirection for you, so you can focus on creating value for your customers.

## How Compensated Works

Compensated is a Ruby gem that you can include directly in your existing Ruby projects, or host as a thin adapter to transform events as they stream in. Think of it like [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/), [Yodlee](https://www.yodlee.com/), [Plaid](https://plaid.com/), or [Griddler](https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler); but for getting paid.

Compensated early alpha, with a few production installations. You can [reach out][contact-email] with your use case and we'll happily weigh in on if it could work for you.

## Get Compensated

### Buy a License

Buying a license while Compensated is in its alpha period locks your price in to $500 per year, forever. You can make the purchase by [emailing us directly][contact-email].

### Free or Paid Support

You can open an issue in our [issue tracker][issue-tracker], [reach out][contact-email] for direct support, or schedule a one hour pair programming session with one of the maintainers, currently $85 for the first hour.

### Read the Source, Luke

All our [source code][source-code] is publicly available. But we are _not_ Open Source.
We require a paid license for commercial use so that we can continue to maintain and update the software.
This constraint also allows us to refuse to grant a license to organizations that violate human rights.
